# Water Quality Prediction

## Introduction

This repository contains the final project submission for the Water Quality Prediction. This project employs machine learning to predict water potability, assessing safety through diverse quality indicators. The dataset includes pH, hardness, and chemical concentrations, forming the basis for predictive models. Addressing imbalances, ethical concerns, and feature analysis, the project contributes to proactive water quality management, aiming for global access to clean and safe drinking water.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA tasks focus on visualizing missing values, understanding the distribution of potability, exploring relationships between columns, calculating correlations, and creating histograms. These steps collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

## Results

The project employed various machine learning algorithms for classification, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVM), Naive Bayes, and XGBoost. SVM stood out for its robust performance, demonstrating superior accuracy and a balanced precision-recall trade-off compared to other models.

## Conclusion

The Water Quality Prediction project contributes to the intersection of data science and public health by leveraging machine learning techniques to ensure safe drinking water. The results highlight the potential of SVM for accurate water quality classification.
